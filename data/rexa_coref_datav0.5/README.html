<h2>Rexa Coreference Dataset Version 0.5</h2>
<br>
10/4/06
<br>
Data is available here: <a
href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~culotta/data/rexa_coref_datav0.5.tgz">rexa_coref_datav0.5.tgz</a> 

<p>
The file citations.xml contains citation data annotated for
coreference among several different entity types: titles, authors,
venues, and institutions. The data was harvested from REXA
(http://rexa.info), a digital library and search engine covering the
computer science research literature and the people who create it.
<p>
Most of the xml format should be self-explanatory. The attributes 'id'
and 'clusterid' have been added to some elements, indicating their
mention id and cluster id, respectively. Additionally, fileid refers
to the file from which the reference was found, and refID identifies
which reference in the paper. The concatenation of fileid and refID
uniquely identifies a reference.

<br><br>Some statistics about the dataset:<br><br>
15524 entity mentions (author title venue institution)
<br>203 clusters
<br>        avg cluster size=19.8669950738916
<br>        max cluster size 301
<br>        min cluster size 1
<br>2454 citation mentions
<br>243 header mentions
<br>9411 authors
<br>2811 titles
<br>2031 venues
<br>1271 institutions

<h3>IMPORTANT</h3> 

Our goal is to construct a large, real-world coreference
dataset. Since labeling all coreference decisions in such a large
dataset is infeasible, we have partially labeled it in the following
way: If a mention is labeled with a clusterid attribute, then all of
its coreferent mentions have been labeled. If a mention does not have
a clusterid attribute, then there may exist coreferent mentions that
have not been labeled as such. The idea is to allow researchers to
leverage this unlabeled data, while still enabling evaluation on the
labeled portion.


<h3>COMING SOON</h3>

In the future, we plan to expand the amount of labeled data as well as
the overlap among the mentions and also include scripts for
partitioning the data and evaluating predictions.

There are likely still errors in the labeling, and we will be updating
and expanding the dataset shortly.
